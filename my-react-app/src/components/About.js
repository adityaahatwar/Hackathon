      <h3>What is an NFT?</h3>
      <p>
        NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or piece of
        content, such as art, music, videos, and more. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NFTs are not
        interchangeable on a one-to-one basis, making each token unique.
